# UrbanMaterialStock_Simulation
Probabilistic simulation framework for estimating urban building material stocks under typology and geometric uncertainty. Includes AutoML-based classification, calibrated typology sampling, and Monte Carlo modeling using RASMI material intensities.

This repository contains the implementation of a probabilistic simulation framework for estimating urban building material stocks under typology and geometric uncertainty. It supports reproducible Monte Carlo simulations, typology classification using AutoML, and analysis of sample size effects on material-specific uncertainty.
